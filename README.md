# 📈 TradingView Scraper (OHLCV Data Extractor)

A Python-based tool to **extract OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) market data** from TradingView for **any market and timeframe**. This project is designed for traders, analysts, and data scientists who need structured market data for analysis, backtesting, and research.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

TradingView provides rich market data but does not allow easy bulk export for free users. This tool bridges that gap by enabling:

* Automated OHLCV data extraction
* Support for multiple exchanges
* Flexible timeframe selection
* Clean, analysis-ready output

This repository demonstrates **financial data engineering skills** combined with **Python automation**.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

* 📊 Extract OHLCV data (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume)
* 🌍 Works with **any TradingView-supported market**
* ⏱️ Multiple timeframes (Intraday / Daily / Weekly / Monthly)
* 🧹 Clean and structured output (CSV / DataFrame ready)
* 🔁 Can be integrated into trading strategies & ML pipelines

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

* **Python** 🐍
* Pandas
* Requests / WebSocket / Selenium *(as applicable)*
* TradingView data source

---

## ▶️ How It Works

1. User provides:

   * Market / Exchange
   * Symbol (e.g. NSE:RELIANCE, NASDAQ:AAPL, BTCUSDT)
   * Timeframe

2. Script connects to TradingView

3. OHLCV data is fetched programmatically

4. Data is saved in a structured format for analysis
